                    <p>The current global pandemic has essentially made conferences and all other types of live events moot. So what do we do as marketers to reach the audience that used to attend these events, now that it is all but impossible to have them? That’s an excellent question and it is certainly one we had to ask since the pandemic started. Thankfully there is an equally excellent and even more simple answer, Virtual Events.</p>

                    <p>Virtual Events are the future for so many types of events. This list includes some of the most common like conferences, trade shows and work/benefit fairs. It can even replace open days on campuses used to recruit talent who are graduating soon or have recently graduated from their college or university. Each type of event has unique characteristics but thankfully they also have many common traits that can help us to ensure the virtual versions are as good if not better than the IRL versions we are all so used to.</p>
                    <span>Pros</span>
                    <p>If you want to throw a great virtual event first you need to understand some of the most common “Pro’s” and “Con’s” of these types of events. The “Pro’s” include them being flexible (you can easily socially distance from your desk). environmentally conscious (you don’t have to fly or drive to your desk) and of course packed with data just ripe for analysis to inform you on your future events and larger marketing strategy. Some other “Pro’s” include being reliable (rain or shine the internet is open), scalable (no need for a bigger event space, the internet is infinite if you have the right events platform), and more engaging (30% of attendees are more likely to engage virtually according to a Forester study). To quote the great Richard Branson “We like to give people the freedom to work where they want, safe in the knowledge that they have the drive and expertise to perform excellently, whether they are at their desk or in their kitchen. Yours truly has never worked out of an office, and never will.”</p>
