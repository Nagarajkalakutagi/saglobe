                        <p>Did you know on an average 41% of the leads delivered by lead generation partners are fake?</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the demand generation industry is plagued by bad actors who either submit fake or incomplete information, recycle old or stolen data, or tamper lead files and recordings.</p>
                        <p>It is thus crucial to monitor and verify the quality of leads before you start pursuing them. The QC Platform gives you complete control to launch, access, and manage your Lead Quality Check Campaign and help you ascertain the quality of your leads.</p>

                        <p>Did you know many of our clients are considering partnering with different vendors because of fake leads?</p>
                        <p>For instance, a few of our clients have reported that a prospect they approached did not even work for the company as mentioned in the lead database!</p>
                        <p>Imagine what these leads mean for your business?
                        <p>
                        <p>Since these leads have been processed they have eroded your marketing and acquisition budget. And they will continue to drain yours/ your clients marketing and sales teams’ time and budget till they stay in your system.</p>
                        <p>With the QC Platform, you can clean-up your vendor-supplied lead database and filter only high-quality ‘genuine’ leads.</p>
                        <p>This means no more spending your resources on false leads and getting the maximum out of your lead generation campaign.</p>
